# Hadoop Docker

## Updated for UofC labs
This repository is highly based on [https://github.com/big-data-europe/docker-hadoop](docker-hadoop). It is edited in a way to have the python on the base image. To deploy the system use this command, for more details see the same repository.

To deploy an example HDFS cluster, run:
```
  docker-compose up
```
